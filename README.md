# pokeget-sprites

## Info

This is just a repository for the sprites of pokeget, since because there are so many sprites it's better to separate the sprites from the code.

## Usage in other projects

pokeget's sprites are taken from multiple sources, but all sources are open source, so you may use the sprites as you wish. All original designs are from game freak, and the non-vanilla sprites are from [pokemon reborn](https://www.rebornevo.com/pr/index.html/).

## How they work

The sprites are saved as .txt files which need true-color support to be displayed properly.
